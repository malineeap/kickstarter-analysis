# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to better understand what factors influence Kickstarter Theater campaign outcomes. We will specifically evaluate how the Launch Date and Funding Goals of prior Theater campaigns have contributed to their success or failure. Knowing this information provides guidance for similar future projects and creates a comparison baseline for the recently completed Fever campaign. 

## Analysis and Challenges
This analysis was completed in Excel using a Kickstarter data set of all campaigns initiated between May 2009-March 2017. Pivot tables and charting methods were applied to the data set to identify key learnings. The analysis focuses specifically on the Theatrical category and on the Plays sub-category.
